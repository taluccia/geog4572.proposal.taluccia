**Motivation:**

- Across central interior British Columbia, Canada, nearly 20 million hectares of lodgepole pine dominated forested have been affected by high rates of tree mortality cause by the most recent mountain pine beetle outbreak (circa 1999). Forests are an integral part of the landscape providing wildlife habitat, ecosystems services such as carbon sequestration, economic value in terms of timber harvest and recreation. 
- The magnitude of mass mortality associated with beetle outbreak has been so extensive that wildfires are burning through forests that have been dead for over a decade. Dead forest burn differently then live forests. Dead forest burn more severely in terms of coarse woody biomass consumption. 
- As lodgepole pine decay after they have been killed by beetles, they move through the postmortem phases that gradually reduce the seedbank over time. By year six the seedbank has been resuded by 45% and at this point trees are in the gray-phaseafter beetle attack trees are in the gray-phase where they have dropped all their needles and branches start to break Seedbank are estimated to be reduced by nearly 45% by year six after initial beetle attack.

**Project Description**

- Generate a storymap to describe what is going on in central interior British Columbian Forests that have been killed by beetles and subsequently burned.

**Data:**

- In this repository there is an image file with photos
- Aerial video footage
- Some field data
- Remote sensing analysis from google earth engine plate form
- Spatial data including: fire perimeters, provincial park boundaries, biogeoclimatic zones, tree species 

**Interface Design:** Storymap
